Tried the place one fine evening when the weather was pleasant.   I loved their sandwiches and coffee. I tried their kafe Kremme which is nothing but a cup of hot coffee topped with ice cream. It was a different concept and it was good to have. Sandwiches are Tummy filling and pricing is also okay.  The place is small and if you manage to get the seat near the balcony , u will enjoy it totally. But most of the times that t...","id":"26018669","rating_color":"9ACD32","review_time_friendly":"2 days ago","rating_text":"Good Enough","timestamp":1452931359,"likes":0,"user":{"name":"Vishal Pandiyan","foodie_level":"Big Foodie","foodie_level_num":7,"foodie_color":"ffae4f","profile_url":"https:\/\/www.zomato.com\/users\/vishal-pandiyan-497356?utm_source=api_basic_user&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=v2.1","profile_image":"https:\/\/p1.zmtcdn.com\/image\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/63e\/037efd426fa86028fc68320507f9163e_100_thumb.jpg","profile_deeplink":"zomato:\/\/u\/497356"},"comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":2,"review_text":"Gave it 2 for the location.

Sandwiches are superb. Achi kozhi(chicken) stroganoff(rice) and meen(fish) stroganoff(rice), although having similar taste, both are good.  Veg sizzler was not bad but not very boring too. Choco Mud pie was good. I wanted to have brownie but sadly it got over.  Disliked:  1. Hot chocolate. Its just bitter milk with no sugar. Avoid.  2. Chicken cordon bleu(chicken breast with cheese) Had high hopes with this one but the cheese was not juicy and that made whole dish was very dry.","id":"25974557","rating_color":"9ACD32","review_time_friendly":"8 days ago","rating_text":"Good Enough","timestamp":1452454927,"likes":0,"user":{"name":"Vipul Sinha","zomato_handle":"vipulvs","foodie_level":"Foodie","foodie_level_num":3,"foodie_color":"ffd35d","profile_url":"https:\/\/www.zomato.com\/vipulvs?utm_source=api_basic_user&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=v2.1","profile_image":"https:\/\/p1.zmtcdn.com\/image\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/8ef\/d6cf2361bc4bd2e9161ab6c8794128ef_100_thumb.jpg","profile_deeplink":"zomato:\/\/u\/15805073"},"comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":3.5,"review_text":"Frankly the best thing about this place is its location.  Located on the beach road, first floor. If you sit outside on evening you can enjoy the cool breeze with burgers or pasta. Burgers are good.

My husband found this place after we discovered all other eat outs are over crowded on the 1st Jan. Even being crowded they managed to give a good quality service with no compromise on the taste of the too. The menu is neat loaded with yummy delicious food varieties. I enjoyed the chicken sizzler, the fried onions and the mashed potato, were really good. The Jalsa vegie toast was yummy too..\u00a0 I really loved the place and will visit again soon","id":"25942796","rating_color":"3F7E00","review_time_friendly":"11 days ago","rating_text":"Loved it!","timestamp":1452167970,"likes":0,"user":{"name":"Neshini Bharathi","foodie_level":"Foodie","foodie_level_num":3,"foodie_color":"ffd35d","profile_url":"https:\/\/www.zomato.com\/users\/neshini-bharathi-193128?utm_source=api_basic_user&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=v2.1","profile_image":"https:\/\/p1.zmtcdn.com\/image\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/688\/d840a994694010a417b71e1b0f708688_100_thumb.jpg","profile_deeplink":"zomato:\/\/u\/193128"},"comments_count":0}}],"Respond to reviews via Zomato Dashboard":"https:\/\/www.zomato.com\/business\/claim?ref=rpg&resid=65340#claim"}
